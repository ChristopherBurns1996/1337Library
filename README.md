## Brief



<p>Our brief was to create a piece of software that implemented CRUD functionality in 2 database tables using the technologies and techniques we had learned in our first 6-8 weeks at QAC.</p>


<a name="solution"></a>


## Solution

<p>My solution for this project was to create a games library that would allow the user to keep track of the games they own. The application will contain 2 tables, one for games, and one for the publishers who make games. There will be a front end website which will allow the user to create records in the tables, read the data from the tables, update the data in the tables, and delete records from the tables.</p>

### Entity Relationship Diagram

#### Intial ERD

<p>put in link to intial er diagram</p>

<p>The ERD shown here was the initial plan which contained 4 tables. One for games, one for publishers, one for individual libraries, and one for the users of the system. In order to meet a MVP within the time frame, the user and library tables were removed, and the game and publisher tables were perserved to maintain the core functionality of the system.</p>

#### Final ERD

<p>put in link to final er diagram</p>

<p>The ERD shown here is the final plan for the site. It features 2 tables, and contains a 1 to many relationship between the publisher and games table, as one publisher could have made many games.</p>
